Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

As part of The Odin Project, the game is developed in some versions.

  First, only to run in the console.
  Second, adding styles.
  Third, as part of the second, using the DOM.

The logical of my code is about using a random number between 1 to 3 and select:
  1: Rock
  2: Paper
  3: Scissors

Then, the computer choice is evaluated with an entry by the user, which must be a text with: rock, paper, or scissors. It could be any case, because the entry is converted to lower case to get it a case insensitive entry. If a wrong entry is found, a message is showed in the console and the prompt is reloaded.

Finally, 5 games are executed and a counter runs to evaluate a winner (You or the computer). It could be possible a tie.
